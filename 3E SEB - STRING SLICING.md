## SEB - SUM OF EVEN NUMBERS FROM LIST

### AIM  
To Write a python program to display the sum of all the values which are ending with 2 from a list

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Use eval() to get a list a from the user.
3. Initialize sum to 0.
4. Use a for loop to iterate through each element in the list a:
5. If the element is even (i.e., i % 2 == 0), add it to sum.
4. Print the total sum of the even numbers in the list.
5. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
Reg No-212222060126
Name - Kristipati Shivani

a=eval(input())
sum=0
for i in a:
    if i%2==0:
        sum+=i
print("Sum=",sum)
```
